KnowedPad
---

This is a simple iOS app to use the "Knowed" framework, which is
intended to make JavaScriptCore a little more useful in practice.
It's a simple JavaScript scratchpad.  You can type in expressions,
and they're evaluated, and the result is added to a scrolling history
view.

If you want to work on this without going crazy, check out
"KnowedStuff".  Maybe some day I'll learn CocoaPods.
